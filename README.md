Here is my Portfolio. Had fun with this one. Changed my mind on the colour scheme a bit and know there is a lot of blue going on but thought it could be apart of a clients acceptance criteria at some point so would be a good challenge. Started off as a struggle to get used to Flexbox and visualising it. If I started again i would try to make it more simple and straight forward but happy showing all the correct information needed.
